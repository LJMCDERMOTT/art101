			<img src="toyota.jpg" width="500"/>
			</div>
			<p>Working with a partner to practice using arrays and objects in Javascript.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>Reece and I had a little difficulty getting the object to appear in our local browser. But we were able to fix it by going back and looking at the code to find the mistakes we typed.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>We were able to do everything properly, but we are having problems with time because it took us awhile to do this lab.
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Do you hear that? It is my partner and I cheering becuase we accomplished another lab! Check it out.</p>
