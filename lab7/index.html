		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>We had trouble getting our script output to show on the browser, so we went through our code and found all the minor errors together. We were able to find those problems and it printed perfectly.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I did not have any problems other than creating a lab 7 with the file structure on my PC. But, we were able to figure it out.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Here is our finished work!</p>
