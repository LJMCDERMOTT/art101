		<h1> LJ's Homepage </h1>
			<p> My name is Lindsey McDermott. I prefer the name LJ, but I am okay with either name. My pronouns are she/her. I was born in Ventura, California. I have lived there my whole life up till moving to college in Santa Cruz this year. I am currently a freshman and a proposed art major. My artistic interests are in oil pastels, charcols, and painting with arcylics. When I am not painting, I am finding new coffee shops or swimming around the pier or somewhere out in the ocean.  </p>
