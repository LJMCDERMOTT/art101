		<h2>Challenges</h2>
	  <p> Reece and I had difficulty getting the HTML to link to the outside source. We realized it was an issue with the source link and we also had to call the words in the link and the function in order for it to find the quote we wanted it to print in our HTML.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
  	<p> I never got my output to print. My code matches my partners identically and there are no errors in the console. It decided to not work for my computer, but we know it works becuase it worked on her computer.We beleive there must be some external issue with the JSON and COR that is not allowing my output to print. </p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>We were able to get the output to print on Reece's computer. There is something wrong with my comuter and is not excepting the link. We got the Javascript to work when the button is pressed and I changed my CSS to something new.</p>
