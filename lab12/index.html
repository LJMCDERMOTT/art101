	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>We were challenged with creating something different from the Harry Potter sorting hat. </p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>We had problems with getting the output after we typed our names into the text box, but we combed through it and got it to return.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>We were able to complete the assignment fairly quick. Reece and I worked together to make up the hunger games and change the code and variables to say district and then including the numbers to add to the theme. Type in your name to see what district you belong to!</p>
<div class= "input-output">
	<h3>Welcome to the Hunger Games</h3>
	<p>Are you ready to find out who will be fighting this year?</p>
	Please enter your FULL name for sorting:
