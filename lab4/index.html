<pre><code>

	//Give the red coins to one player and the black coins to the other player
	//Create a 6x7 grid
	//First player inserts one of their coins into a column of their choosing
	//After, second player inserts one of their coins into a column of their choosing
	//Each player evaluates possible moves before inserting their coins
	//Repeat steps 3 and 4, alternating players
	//One of the players wins by having four of their same colored coins in a row
