		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> We had difficutly figuring out how to make the titles for Javascript, and also doing the coding without the example references.We also were confused when we got to the "name-sort" function and the "event listener."</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p> Besides the Challenges, we did not have any problems on this lab that we were unable to fix.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>My partner and I were able to fully complete the lab, going task by task and helping eachother out.</p>
