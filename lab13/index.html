		<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>I had difficulty getting the ouput to appear. When I pressed the run button, it did nothing and my console did not say there was anything wrong with it. </p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>My problems were mainly just figuring out how to print the table and have the words appear next to the mulitples.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>I was able to complete the lab, and get the run button to function and print my words in the table.</p>
