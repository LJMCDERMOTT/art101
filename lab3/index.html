	<h1>Lab 3</h1>
	<h2>The Subject of this Lab</h2>
		<p>The subject is learning how to navigate and organize between folders. As well as understanding file structures and practicing with HTML.</p>
		<h3>Difficulties</h3>
		<p> My partner and I had trouble with our images. When we places our images into an image folder the HTMl could not find the images. Whereas when we took it out of the img folder and just put it as part of the art101 folder, they were able to appear.</p>
		<h4>Results of Our Work</h4>
		<p>We were able to uploud our individual homepages with everything we put in our HTML, including the links and the profile photo. We were also able to add our screenshots to the lab3 img/folder. Here is all of our screenshots for this Lab 3!</p>
