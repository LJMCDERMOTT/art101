		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>My partner and I had most of our troubles in the console, due to minor misspelling and errors. But through trial and error, we messed around with it for a little and got a better understanding of coding callbacks and functions. </p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Same as above, most of our issues for this lab was figuring out hw to make our functions work properly within the console.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>This is our completed Lab 8 assignment. Eight down, several more to go!</p>
